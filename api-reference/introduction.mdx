description: "Complete reference for all Notebooks API endpoints."

The Notebooks API follows REST conventions and uses JSON for requests and responses.

## Base URL

```
https://dashboard.notebooks.app/api/v1
```

## Authentication

All endpoints require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer nb_sk_your_key_here
```

Create API keys in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.notebooks.app/dashboard/settings/api). See the [authentication guide](/authentication) for details.

## Content type

All requests must include:

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Rate limits

You can make up to **30 requests per minute** per API key. The API returns rate limit info in response headers:

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests per minute |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp (ms) when the limit resets |

If you exceed the limit, you'll receive a `429` status code. Wait until the reset time before retrying.

## Credits

Every API request consumes credits from your account. The amount depends on the model used and tokens consumed. Different [pricing tiers](/models#pricing-tiers) have different credit costs.

The response includes standard OpenAI token usage:

```json
{
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 1250,
    "completion_tokens": 340,
    "total_tokens": 1590
  }
}
```

Check your balance and top up at [Settings > Billing](https://dashboard.notebooks.app/dashboard/settings/billing).

## Error format

All errors follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "A human-readable description of what went wrong.",
    "type": "authentication_error",
    "code": "invalid_api_key",
    "param": null
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `message` | What went wrong and how to fix it |
| `type` | Error category: `authentication_error`, `invalid_request_error`, `rate_limit_error`, `insufficient_credits`, `server_error` |
| `code` | Machine-readable code: `missing_api_key`, `invalid_api_key`, `invalid_request_body`, `rate_limit_exceeded`, `insufficient_credits`, `no_subscription`, `internal_error` |
| `param` | The request parameter that caused the error (if applicable) |

## HTTP status codes

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `200` | Success |
| `400` | Invalid request body — check the `param` field for details |
| `401` | Authentication failed — missing or invalid API key |
| `403` | Insufficient credits or no active subscription |
| `404` | Node not found or you don't have access to it |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded — wait and retry |
| `500` | Internal server error — try again or contact support |
