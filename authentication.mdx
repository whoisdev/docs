Every request to the Notebooks API must include an API key. This page explains how keys work, how to create them, and how to keep them safe.

## How API keys work

Notebooks API keys:
- Start with the prefix `nb_sk_` followed by 40 hexadecimal characters
- Are tied to your user account — the API uses your credits
- Can be deactivated or deleted from the dashboard at any time

Example key format: `nb_sk_a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2`

## Create an API key

1. Log in to your [Notebooks dashboard](https://dashboard.notebooks.app).
2. Go to **Settings > API**.
3. Click **Create API Key**.
4. Copy the key immediately — you won't see it again.

<Warning>
  Your full API key is only shown once at creation time. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new one.
</Warning>

## Send your key with requests

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

<CodeGroup>

```bash curl
curl -X POST https://dashboard.notebooks.app/api/v1/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer nb_sk_your_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ ... }'
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://dashboard.notebooks.app/api/v1/chat",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer nb_sk_your_key_here",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    json={ ... },
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://dashboard.notebooks.app/api/v1/chat", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer nb_sk_your_key_here",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ ... }),
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Security best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables" icon="lock" defaultOpen>
    Never hardcode your API key in source code. Store it in an environment variable:

    ```bash .env
    NOTEBOOKS_API_KEY=nb_sk_your_key_here
    ```

    Then read it in your code:

    ```python Python
    import os
    api_key = os.environ["NOTEBOOKS_API_KEY"]
    ```

    ```javascript JavaScript
    const apiKey = process.env.NOTEBOOKS_API_KEY;
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Never commit keys to git" icon="code-branch">
    Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally pushing your key to a repository:

    ```bash .gitignore
    .env
    .env.local
    .env.*.local
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate keys if compromised" icon="arrows-rotate">
    If you think your key has been exposed:
    1. Go to **Settings > API** in your dashboard.
    2. Deactivate the compromised key.
    3. Create a new key and update your application.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use one key per application" icon="grid-2">
    Create separate API keys for each application or environment (development, staging, production). This way you can revoke access to one without affecting the others.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Error responses

If authentication fails, the API returns a `401` status with a structured error:

**Missing key** — no `Authorization` header:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Missing API key. Include it as: Authorization: Bearer nb_sk_...",
    "type": "authentication_error",
    "code": "missing_api_key",
    "param": null
  }
}
```

**Invalid key** — wrong format or deactivated:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid API key. Check that your key is correct and active in your dashboard at Settings > API.",
    "type": "authentication_error",
    "code": "invalid_api_key",
    "param": null
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  The API returns the same error message for non-existent and deactivated keys to prevent key enumeration.
