title: "Quickstart"
description: "Make your first Notebooks API call in under 2 minutes."
---

<Info>
  **Prerequisites:**
  - A [Notebooks account](https://dashboard.notebooks.app) with an active subscription
  - An API key (you'll create one below)
  - A notebook with at least one node (you'll need its `nodeId`)
</Info>

## Step 1: Create an API key

1. Go to [Settings > API](https://dashboard.notebooks.app/dashboard/settings/api) in your dashboard.
2. Click **Create API Key**.
3. Copy the key. It starts with `nb_sk_` and you'll only see it once.

<Warning>
  Store your key somewhere safe. You won't be able to see it again after you leave the page.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Get your node ID

Every API request needs a `nodeId` — this tells the AI which notebook node to use as context.

1. Open a notebook in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.notebooks.app).
2. Connect the documents and sources you want the AI to have access to.
3. Click **API** in the toolbar at the bottom of the node.
4. Copy your **Node ID** from the API Access panel. You'll also see your **Brand Voice ID** here if you have one set up, and a ready-to-use example request.

<Warning>
  Deleting a node in your notebook will permanently disable API access for that `nodeId`. Any requests using a deleted node's ID will fail.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Install an SDK

The Notebooks API is OpenAI-compatible, so you can use the OpenAI SDK or the Vercel AI SDK.

<CodeGroup>

```bash OpenAI SDK (Python)
pip install openai
```

```bash OpenAI SDK (Node.js)
npm install openai
```

```bash Vercel AI SDK
npm install ai @ai-sdk/openai
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 4: Make your first request

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_NODE_ID` below and run the code:

<CodeGroup>

```python OpenAI SDK (Python)
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://dashboard.notebooks.app/api/v1",
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the key topics in this notebook."}
    ],
    extra_body={
        "nodeId": "YOUR_NODE_ID",
    },
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

```typescript OpenAI SDK (Node.js)
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  baseURL: "https://dashboard.notebooks.app/api/v1",
});

const response = await client.chat.completions.create(
  {
    model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6",
    messages: [
      { role: "user", content: "Summarize the key topics in this notebook." },
    ],
  },
  {
    body: {
      nodeId: "YOUR_NODE_ID",
    },
  }
);

console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```

```typescript Vercel AI SDK
import { createOpenAI } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { generateText } from "ai";

const notebooks = createOpenAI({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  baseURL: "https://dashboard.notebooks.app/api/v1",
});

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: notebooks("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6"),
  prompt: "Summarize the key topics in this notebook.",
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      nodeId: "YOUR_NODE_ID",
    },
  },
});

console.log(text);
```

```bash curl
curl -X POST https://dashboard.notebooks.app/api/v1/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6",
    "nodeId": "YOUR_NODE_ID",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Summarize the key topics in this notebook."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 5: See the response

You'll get back a standard OpenAI `ChatCompletion` response:

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-abc123",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Based on your notebook, here are the key topics..."
      },
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 1250,
    "completion_tokens": 340,
    "total_tokens": 1590
  }
}
```

If you've used the OpenAI API before, this will feel familiar — the response format is identical.

## Important: the API is stateless

The Notebooks API does **not** store your conversation history. Each request is independent — it won't see previous messages from other requests, and it won't add messages to the conversation in your dashboard.

This means:

- **You manage the conversation.** To build a multi-turn chatbot, store messages in your own database and send the full conversation in the `messages` array with each request.
- **The `nodeId` provides document context, not chat history.** It gives the model access to your notebook's connected documents — not to any past conversations you've had in the Notebooks app.
- **Each request starts fresh.** The model only knows what you send in the current request's `messages` array.

<Info>
  **Need server-side conversation storage?** If you'd like the API to save and reference conversations by ID instead of managing messages yourself, reach out to [support](mailto:dev@notebooks.app). We can give you access to a newer endpoint that supports conversation persistence.
</Info>

```python
# Example: managing a multi-turn conversation
conversation = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What are the key trends in my niche?"},
]

# First request
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6",
    messages=conversation,
    extra_body={"nodeId": "YOUR_NODE_ID"},
)

# Add the assistant's reply to your conversation
conversation.append({
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": response.choices[0].message.content,
})

# Add the next user message
conversation.append({
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Tell me more about the first trend.",
})

# Second request — send the full conversation
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6",
    messages=conversation,
    extra_body={"nodeId": "YOUR_NODE_ID"},
)
```
