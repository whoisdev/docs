The Notebooks API gives you access to models from four providers through a single endpoint. Pass the model ID as the `model` parameter in your request.

```json

## Choosing a model

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I want the best quality" icon="trophy" defaultOpen>
    Use `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`, `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, or `openai/gpt-5.2`. These are frontier models with the strongest reasoning and writing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I want fast and cheap" icon="bolt">
    Use `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`, `x-ai/grok-4-fast`, or `openai/gpt-4.1-mini`. Great for high-volume use cases where speed matters more than depth.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I want step-by-step thinking" icon="brain">
    Use `openai/gpt-5-thinking`. This model shows its reasoning process, which is useful for math, logic, and complex problem-solving.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm not sure — just pick one" icon="shuffle">
    Start with `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`. It's a strong default with excellent quality across coding, writing, and analysis tasks.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Brand Voice

Pass a `brandVoiceId` to make any model write in your brand's tone and style. Create brand voices in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.notebooks.app), then reference them by ID:

```json
{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6",
  "nodeId": "YOUR_NODE_ID",
  "brandVoiceId": "YOUR_BRAND_VOICE_ID",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "Write a blog intro about AI trends." }
  ]
}
```

The model will retrieve your brand voice guidelines and apply them to the response. This works with all models and is especially useful for content generation workflows.

<Warning>
  The `brandVoiceId` must be a valid brand voice that belongs to your account. If the ID doesn't exist or you don't have access, the API will return an error.
</Warning>
